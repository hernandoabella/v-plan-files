                <p>Construction project management is no longer about a small team managed by a supervisor and a project
                    manager, all working at the same location. Modern-day construction projects involve multiple
                    projects being
                    undertaken at different locations. Managers and owners are not only focusing on the delivery side of
                    things.
                    They simultaneously need to collaborate with cross-functional teams within the company as well as
                    deal with
                    outsourcing service providers and suppliers. And the fact of the matter remains that the project
                    managers
                    and owners can not be present at all the locations all of the time. having real-time information
                    about
                    simultaneous projects is the need of the hour. And efficiency is definitely the name of the game.
                </p>

                <p>While project managment has several challenges, we try to discuss a few of them in this article.</p>

        <p>Estimation is the key to a successful project. It will not only avoid cost and time overruns, it also ensures
            efficiency in the overall project. Accurate estimates for time forecasting and resource utilization for the
            project's guarantee to achieve profitable ROI. Realtraker™ is a construction management software provided by
            V-Plan Inc, a leading provider of IT-enabled estimation services and SaaS for construction. It features
            project management modules that definitely save complex projects from breaking their budget and miss
            delivery deadlines.</p>

        <p>Realtime project updates are the biggest communication challenge for competent construction managment. Any
            miscommunication can cause unexpected cost and time overruns, leading to improper project co-ordination.
            With Realtraker™, project managers can readily have accurate cloud-based real-time updates. The in-app team
            chat feature comes handy for follow-ups. It also features an in-app eamil and quote request functionality.
            Accurate and timely communication is essential to the success of the project managment.</p>

        <p>Documentation is a key component of handling projects. Documents are like blood flowing in veins of the body.
            Documents like forms for submittals, RFIs, change orders, material submittals, ect flow somoothly across
            project channels for the proper functioning of the project. Document management can be done digitally with
            the Realtraker™ app.</p>

        <p>Planning and organization of construction projects can face roadblocks while working with remote worker and
            outsourcing service providers. Processes of preparing tasks, delegation, and schedule planning ensure that
            projects runs smoothly. Capacity planning, resource planning, coordination, collaboration, workflow planning
            are the components that ownsers and managers have to take care of. Realtraker™ readily handles resource and
            contact management by creating contacts, subcontractors, vendors as well as equipment and machinery
            databases. These entities and components can be easily assigned to projects.</p>

        <p>Schedule management involves identifying the time period each project component consumes to contribute to
            project completion. it also helps in identifying the key processes that are critical to sucessful project
            completion. Project managers need to lay extra focus on these critical processes to ensure quality delivery.
            Gantt charts and schedule interruptions are recorded and tracked individually on the Realtraker app.
            Inaccurate billing for inactive projects (projects on hold) may entail tax implications. Realtraker™ makes
            it easy to manage such situations. Moreover, cashflow managment including revenue and expenses forecasting
            for the project can be performed within the app. Generate cash flow charts and manage projects with well
            informed, analysis-backed decisions. You can view the charts as line, histogram, and a curved line. The best
            feature of the app is that you can perform risk mitigation for each of your projects, hence avoid delays and
            cost overruns.</p>
