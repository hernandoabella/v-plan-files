                <p>
                    With over 30 years of experience, V Plan’s team of experts can help you craft a strategy with
                    estimations on project costs from start to finish.
                    <br><br>
                    We work with your company to look over projects, create estimates on materials costs, contractors
                    needed, length of projects, and a whole lot more.
                    <br><br>
                    Getting estimates right is key to making a profit on construction projects. Because projects can
                    change
                    so dramatically throughout the process, you need to be ready to make changes on the fly, knowing
                    your
                    next problem before it happens.

                            the numbers and data are critical. Until I found Realtraker™, there hasn’t been an
                            affordable option to capture this information in one place. I was using 3 online tools and
                            notebooks to capture and track information daily. I HIGHLY recommend Realtraker™ to any
                            business of any size. The construction industry has very unique quirks about it, but I can
                            say Realtraker™ is a priceless asset.”</blockquote>
